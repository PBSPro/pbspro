How to install PBS Pro using the configure script.

- Unpack the tarball and cd to the package directory.

- Run "./configure --help" to see the available build parameters.

- Run "./configure --prefix=/opt/pbs" with any additional options
  set appropriately for your installation. (See note 1 below)

- Run "make". (See note 2 below)

- Run "sudo make install". The installation directory (--prefix)
  will require root privilege for this step.

- Run "sudo <prefix>/libexec/pbs_postinstall"

- Edit /etc/pbs.conf to configure the PBS Pro services that
  should be started.

- Some file permissions must be modified to add SUID privilege.
  Run "sudo chmod 4755 /opt/pbs/sbin/pbs_iff /opt/pbs/sbin/pbs_rcp"

- Start the PBS Pro services by running "sudo /etc/init.d/pbs start"

Note 1: It is advisable to create a simple shell script
  that calls configure with the appropriate options so that you
  can save typing on reconfigures. If you have already run configure
  you can remake all of the Makefiles by running "./config.status".
  Also, looking at the first few lines of config.status will
  tell you the options that were set when configure was run.
  To figure out which options one can set run "./configure --help"
  

Note 2: You need to use a POSIX (or nearly POSIX) make. GNU make
  works quite well in this regard; BSD make does not. If you are
  having any sort of build problems, your make should be a prime suspect.
  Tremendous effort has been expended to provide proper dependency
  generation and makefiles without relying on any non-POSIX features. 
  The build should work fine with a simple call to make, however,
  complicating things by using various make flags is not guaranteed
  to work. Don't be surprised if the first thing that make does is
  call configure again. See the note in Makefile.in if this happens.

If you need to modify configure.ac you will need to install the GNU
automake package.
